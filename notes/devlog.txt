Maybe aesthetic.computer is more of an interface project
or search engine or *branded* prompt than it is a creative
platform?

-> GitHub Codespaces (Manual Setup):
  A. For running the frontend:
    1. `cd` into `system` and then `npm install`
    2. login to netlify via `npx netlify login`
    3. install git lfs to get media files: `git lfs install; git lfs pull`
    4. install mkcert
    - sudo apt install libnss3-tools
    - install homebrew for linux: https://brew.sh
    - install mkcert with `brew install mkcert` 
    - generate certificates and place them in `/ssl-dev`
    5. now you can run `npm run codespaces-dev` to start the frontend,
       fully simulating the netlify production environment
       (with exception to the automatic https tunneling in spaces)
  B. For running the server backend:
    1. `cd` into `server` and then `npm install`
    2.  add `NODE_ENV=development` to a `.env` file in `server`
    3.  Note: websockets (wss) cannot be port forwarded by codespaces atm
