🧪 Dev Log
Practical and conceptual notes, weaved together.

☁️ Ideas
Maybe aesthetic.computer is more of an interface project
or search engine or *branded* prompt than it is a creative
platform?

TODO
- [] Get my dotfiles working (especially get fish running) in github codespaces.
  - [] Wipe dotfiles repository.
  - [] Start a fresh set from this codespace that simply symlinks a few things,
       like my fish settings, and installs anything I need via an install.sh script.
  - [] Can this script actually be written in fish scripting language?

- Start over with my dotfiles...

  - [] Follow along here: https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/codespaces-terminal

🧑‍💻 Text Editor
- [] Try AceJump, Use thinkpad more often, Try: https://github.com/machakann/vim-swap
- [] Figure out how to swap vim panes with one another in neovim: https://github.com/wesQ3/vim-windowswap,

-> GitHub Codespaces (Manual Setup):
  A. Clone my dotfiles repo and install chezmoi via the chezmoi/dotfiles install.sh script.
  B. For running the frontend:
    1. `cd` into `system` and then `npm install`
    2. login to netlify via `npx netlify login`
    3. install git lfs to get media files: `git lfs install; git lfs pull`
    5. now you can run `npm run codespaces-dev` (or `npm run code` from the root dir)
       to start the frontend, fully simulating the netlify production environment
       (with exception to the automatic https tunneling via nginx in the codespaces container)
  C. For running the server backend:
    1. `cd` into `server` and then `npm install`
    2.  add `NODE_ENV=development` to a `.env` file in `server`
    3.  Note: websockets (wss) cannot be port forwarded by codespaces atm
