-> GitHub Codespaces (Manual Setup):
  For running the frontend:
    1. `cd` into `system` and then `npm install`
    2. login to netlify via `npx netlify login`
    3. install git lfs to get media files: `git lfs install; git lfs pull`
    4. install mkcert
    - sudo apt install libnss3-tools
    - install homebrew for linux: https://brew.sh
    - install mkcert with `brew install mkcert` 
    - generate certificates and place them in `/ssl-dev`
    5. now you can run `npm run codespaces-dev` to start the frontend,
       fully simulating the netlify production environment
       (with exception to the automatic https tunneling in spaces)
