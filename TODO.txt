üåü Current

Make the prompt / shell program.
  - What if glyphs must be drawn to open or close disks...
  - First command should be load?

‚è≥ Next

Stop tracks in all mediaStreams: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12436772
(Video and Microphone)

Add pixels via: https://codepen.io/oceangermanique/pen/LqaPgO.

Adjust pixel scaling / `frame` algorithm so that pixels are always the same size
at different scale levels.

Add $api.sound.beatCount counter to `beat`.

üì© Future

üìÖ End of January
  - Shader situation. `const fragmentEffect = video('webgl', screen.width, screen.height)`
  - Research software shaders.

What would a build script for releasing a single disk or
stack of disks look like?

  1. Make a new directory D for the build.
  2. Copy a subset of /disks/public to D/disks
  3. Copy index.html, style.css, boot.js and /computer to D.
  4. Modify boot.js to start loading from the first listed disk.
  5. Generate metadata.json for the work.
  6. Zip and upload to fxHash or put whole directory into Pinata.
  7. Test to make sure everything works.
  8. Mint on a contract (or Cancel and remove files from IPFS).

What would a full system / suite release look like?

1. Using the build script with a set of chosen disks where the main
  disk is a shell interface.

TODO: Make my first generative disk / piece and mint it.
      - Test it in Chrome / Safari / and Firefox.

TODO: Add system font / main shell / terminal? (Working in "plot / prompt").

TODO: Make a quick fullscreen button (make a new keyboard input module).

TODO: Finish Oliver + Mija's tracker / player interface.

TODO: Add a new deployment scheme that actually allows my websocket server to
      function... this might mean leaving behind Vercel or configuring it
      for different directories in my repository, running separate server code
      for sockets.

TODO: Add syntax notification of some kind for disk files, using a comment at
      the top. This would eventually allow me to completely
      change from JavaScript.

TODO: Add stochastic syntax / DSL for basic drawing?
      Example: wipe.ink.line.line.line.ink("red").box;

TODO: What cryptocurrency / web3.js lib would I hook an editor up to
      for minting, uploading edition data, etc?

TODO: Make a video-recording app that generates 3 letter codes? - to augment
      my hand-written notes and pages.

TODO: Add ability to define the logical / simulation framerate.

TODO: Give myself the ability to automate testing of system using "robot".

TODO: Write a simple note taking program with saving and loading of drawings
 and also recording and playback?

TODO: Ink types? ... can they be procedural using a buffer?
TODO: Fix Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247687
